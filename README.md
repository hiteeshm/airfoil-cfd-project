Objective - To compare Aerodynamic forces acting on a symmetrical aerofoil and a cambered airfoil, focusing on how shape and Angle of Attack can affect the Aerodynamics of an airfoil

Tools used: NASA FoilSim

Methodology - Selected two airfoils - Symmetrical (e.g NACA 0012) and Cambered (e.g NACA 2412). Simulated airflow over each airfoil using NASA Foilsim. Varied Angle of Attack (0,5,15) and recorded lift, drag and coefficient values. Compared and analyzed how airfoil shapes and Angle of Attack affect aerodynamic peformance

Observations at 100 km/h, 100 m altitude -

Symmetrical Airfoil at 0 AOA - 0N lift, 0.00 Lift Coefficient, 70N drag, 0.017 Drag coefficient

Symmetrical Airfoil at 5 AOA - 2323N lift, 0.58 Lift Coefficient, 254N drag, 0.064 Drag coefficient

Symmetrical Airfoil at 15 AOA - 5619N lift, 1.41 Lift coefficient, 1337N drag, 0.336 Drag coefficient

Analysis for Symmetrical Airfoil - 
0AOA
It could be observed that the Symmetrical Airfoil has different force values at different Angles of Attack. Firstly, the Symmetrical Airfoil produces 0 lift at 0 AOA as both upper and lower surfaces are identical, airflow is evenly split. According to Newton'a Third Law of Motion, "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction." This applies to Lift too. Along with Bernoulli's principle, it could be explained that lift is generated as air is pushed downward. However, at 0 AOA, the Symmetrical Airfoil is pushing minimal air downward leading to no lift being generated. 

5AOA
It could be observed that the Symmetrical Airfoil does produce lift at 5 AOA. Lift is generated as air is being pushed downward because of a higher angle of elevation. However, in the aerodynamic world, it is considered weak and only enough to lift a glider or around 4 ppl weighing 60 kgs. As the Airfoil is tilted a bit more higher than before, more air is being deflecting downward and as explained by Newton's Third Law of Motion, lift is generated, 

15AOA
It could be observed that the Symmetrical Airfoil produces much more lift at 15 AOA. However, at a much higher AOA, there is a lot more airflow seperation. This leads to induced drag and reduces the aerodynamic efficieny of the Airfoil. 

Observations at 100 km/h, 100 m altitude -

Cambered Airfoil at 0 AOA - 2351N lift, 0.59 Lift coefficient, 241N drag, 0.060 Drag coefficient

Cambered Airfoil at 5 AOA - 4459N lift, 1.12 Lift coefficient, 770N drag, 0.193 Drag coefficient

Cambered Airfoil at 15 AOA - 7206N lift, 1.81 Lift coefficient, 2041N drag, 0.513 Drag coefficient

Analysis for Cambered Airfoil-
0AOA
It could be observed that even at 0AOA, the Cambered Airfoil generates much more lift compared to the symmetrical Airfoil. As a Cambered Airfoil has a more curved upper surface, air is deflected downwards much more efficiently creating much more lift at 0 AOA. Most commercial airliners use Cambered Airfoil for wings at different AOA for aerodynamic effiency at a good enough Lift to Drag ratio. 

5AOA
It could be observed that both the Lift and Drag have increased. At a much higher value, the lift being generated is caused due to more air deflection downward. However, the drag value has also been increased. Drag has increased due to greater airflow disturbance. 

15AOA
It could be observed that Cambered Airfoil at 15AOA is the highest observed at 7206N. The lift has increased significantly compared to other AOA however, the Drag value has increased much more too. This means it isn't aerodynamically efficient at all as the lift to drag ratio is very low making it inefficient. This happens often at higher AOA, even observed in the symmetrical Airfoil. This happens due to flow seperation and induced drag. 

Conclusion - 
We can conclude that both the shape and Angle of Attack of an Airfoil can affect it's aerodynamic efficieny by a lot. Hence, it is important to use the right Airfoil and the right Angle of Attack to attain the best Lift to Drag ratio possible.
